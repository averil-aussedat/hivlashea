  abstract = {We are interested in developing a numerical method for capturing stationary sheaths, that a plasma forms in contact with a metallic wall. This work is based on a bi-species (ion/electron) Vlasov-Amp`ere model proposed in [3]. The main question addressed in this work is to know if classical numerical schemes can preserve stationary solutions with boundary conditions, since these solutions are not a priori conserved at the discrete level. In the context of high-order semi-Lagrangian method, due to their large stencil, interpolation near the boundary of the domain requires also a specific treatment.},

  abstract = {This article is an account of the NABUCO project achieved during the summer camp CEMRACS 2019 devoted to geophysical fluids and gravity flows. The goal is to construct finite difference approximations of the transport equation with nonzero incoming boundary data that achieve the best possible convergence rate in the maximum norm. We construct, implement and analyze the so-called inverse Lax-Wendroff procedure at the incoming boundary. Optimal convergence rates are obtained by combining sharp stability estimates for extrapolation boundary conditions with numerical boundary layer expansions. We illustrate the results with the Lax-Wendroff and               O               3 schemes.                        ,              Cet article est un compte-rendu du projet NABUCO r\'ealis\'e au cours du CEMRACS 2019 qui \'etait consacr\'e aux fluides g\'eophysiques et aux \'ecoulements gravitaires. Le but est de construire des approximations par diff\'erences finies de l'\'equation de transport avec une condition d'entr\'ee non-nulle qui donnent lieu au meilleur taux de convergence possible dans la norme de la convergence uniforme.                            Nous construisons, impl\'ementons et analysons la proc\'edure, dite de Lax-Wendroff inverse, pour les mailles d'entr\'ee. Des taux de convergence optimaux sont obtenus en combinant des estimations de stabilit\'e fines pour les conditions d'extrapolation en sortie et des d\'eveloppements de type couche limite. Nous illustrons les r\'esultats obtenus sur les sch\'emas de Lax-Wendroff et               O               3.},

  abstract = {The mathematical description of the interaction between a plasma and a solid surface is a major issue that still remains challenging. In this paper, we model this interaction as a stationary and bi-kinetic Vlasov-Poisson-Amp`ere boundary value problem with boundary conditions that are consistent with the physics. In particular, we show that the wall potential can be determined from the ampibolarity of the particle flows as the unique solution of a non linear equation. Based on variational techniques, our analysis establishes the wellposedness of the model, provided that the incoming ion distribution satisfies a moment condition that generalizes the historical Bohm criterion of plasma physics. Quantitative estimates are also given, together with numerical illustrations that validate the robustness of our approach.},

In view of this result, the Lax-Wendroff and the Gottlieb-Turkel schemes are applied to a test problem. As expected from the rate-of-convergence theory by Gustafsson, global order of accuracy is preserved if outflow boundary computations employ extrapolation of (local) accuracy of the same order.},
