ABSTRACT={A one-dimensional Vlasov–Poisson simulation code is employed to investigate the plasma sheath considering electron-induced secondary electron emission (SEE) and backscattering. The SEE coefficient is commonly treated as constant in a range of plasma simulations; here, an improved SEE model of a charged dielectric wall is constructed, which includes the wall charging effect on the SEE coefficient and the energy dependency of the SEE coefficient. Pertinent algorithms to implement the previously mentioned SEE model in plasma simulation are studied in detail. It is found that the SEE coefficient increases with the amount of negative wall charges, which in turn reduces the emissive sheath potential. With an energy-dependent SEE coefficient, the sheath potential is a nonlinear function of the plasma electron temperature, as opposed to the linear relation predicted by the classic emissive sheath theory. Simulation combining both wall-charging effect and SEE coefficient’ energy dependency suggests that the space-charged limited sheath is formed at high plasma electron temperature levels, where both sheath potential and surface charging saturate. Additionally, different algorithms to implement the backscattering in the kinetic simulation are tested and compared. Converting backscattered electrons to secondary electrons via an effective SEE coefficient barely affects the sheath properties. The simulation results are shown to be commensurate with the upgraded sheath theory predictions.}

In this paper, we propose to model this interaction by considering a stationary bi-species Vlasov-Poisson-Boltzmann boundary value problem with boundary conditions that are consistent with the physics. In particular, we show that the wall potential can be uniquely determined from the ambipolarity of the particles flows as the unique solution of a nonlinear equation. We also prove that it is an increasing function of the electrons re-emission coefficient at the wall. Based on the Schauder fixed point theorem, our analysis establishes the existence of a solution provided, on the one hand that the incoming ions density satisfies a moment condition that generalizes the Historical Bohm criterion, and on the other hand that the collision frequency does not exceed a critical value whose definition is subordinated to the strict validity of our generalized Bohm criterion.},

  abstract = {Numerical methods based on non-uniform splines of varying degrees are used to run kinetic semi-Lagrangian simulations of the plasma sheath. The sheath describes a region of plasma in contact with a wall, acting as a heat, momentum, and particle bath. The latter regulates the current loss and consequently the electric field. At micro scale it then influences the development of plasma turbulence and at a larger scale plasma rotation. However this region is particularly difficult to simulate, due to its kinetic nature and the presence of steep gradients requiring fine numerical resolution. In this work, a new well-conditioned method for determining the coefficients for Schoenberg's ``best'' quadrature is presented, providing improved precision compared to a naive approach based on b-spline derivatives (4 extra significant figures of precision are obtained for coefficients of the fifth order scheme). The construction of a simulation grid from Greville abcissae of judiciously chosen non-uniform knots is shown to reduce the memory requirements by 89\% for the simulation presented. Cubic splines are found to provide a good compromise between fast convergence and controlled oscillations preserving positivity. Despite the reduction in performance associated with using non-uniform spline schemes, effective parallelisation through the use of GPUs leads to non-uniform simulations running 5.5 times faster than uniform simulations providing equivalent results.},

The goal is to construct finite difference approximations of the transport equation with nonzero incoming boundary data that achieve the best possible convergence rate in the maximum norm. We construct, implement and analyze the so-called inverse Lax-Wendroff procedure at the incoming boundary. Optimal convergence rates are obtained by combining sharp stability estimates for extrapolation boundary conditions with numerical boundary layer expansions. We illustrate the results with the Lax-Wendroff and               O               3 schemes.                        ,              Cet article est un compte-rendu du projet NABUCO r\'ealis\'e au cours du CEMRACS 2019 qui \'etait consacr\'e aux fluides g\'eophysiques et aux \'ecoulements gravitaires.

The code solves the Vlasov-Poisson system for two or more kinetic species on a one-dimensional spatial grid between two limiting plates, in the presence of a uniform magnetic field tilted with respect to the normal to the plates. A source-sink term in the Vlasov equation leads to a stationary solution comprising a magnetic and a collisional presheath, as well as the usual Debye sheath in front of the wall. Thanks to a nonuniform spatial grid the sheath structure can be resolved accurately. Several advection schemes are implemented and the code is parallelized. Here, the code is used to illustrate the problems of a stationary sheath-presheath structure in front of a negatively biased wall, with and without a tilted magnetic field.},

Advanced high-resolution methods and permanently increasing performance of computational systems allow this phenomenon to be studied by means of computer simulations at a new level. In this paper, an approach to verification and validation of computer codes implementing high-resolution methods is proposed. The approach is based on comparisons of the simulation results with exact non-stationary solutions of the Vlasov-Poisson equations. The evolution of the gravitating layer model is considered as an example of implementation of this approach. A one-parameter family of exact models of a non-stationary gravitating layer is described, and their stability to large-scale disturbances in the linear approximation is analytically studied. Non-linear instability development is computed with the use of the fifth-order conservative semi-Lagrangian WENO scheme.},

Bohm's criterion expresses a necessary condition for the formation of a stationary sheath in front of a negative absorbing wall. The basic features of the plasma-sheath transition and their relation to the Bohm criterion are discussed and illustrated from a simple cold-ion fluid model. A rigorous kinetic analysis of the vicinity of the sheath edge allows one to generalize Bohm's criterion accounting not only for arbitrary ion and electron distributions, but also for general boundary conditions at the wall. It is shown that the generalized sheath condition is (apart from special exceptions) marginally fulfilled and related to a sheath edge field singularity. Due to this singularity, smooth matching of the presheath and sheath solutions requires an additional transition layer. Previous investigations concerning particular problems of the plasma-sheath transition are reviewed in the light of the general relations.},
