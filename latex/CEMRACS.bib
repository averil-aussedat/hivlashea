  abstract = {We are interested in developing a numerical method for capturing stationary sheaths, that a plasma forms in contact with a metallic wall. This work is based on a bi-species (ion/electron) Vlasov-Amp`ere model proposed in [3]. The main question addressed in this work is to know if classical numerical schemes can preserve stationary solutions with boundary conditions, since these solutions are not a priori conserved at the discrete level. In the context of high-order semi-Lagrangian method, due to their large stencil, interpolation near the boundary of the domain requires also a specific treatment.},

  pages = {35},
  abstract = {Numerical methods based on non-uniform splines of varying degrees are used to run kinetic semi-Lagrangian simulations of the plasma sheath. The sheath describes a region of plasma in contact with a wall, acting as a heat, momentum, and particle bath. The latter regulates the current loss and consequently the electric field. At micro scale it then influences the development of plasma turbulence and at a larger scale plasma rotation. However this region is particularly difficult to simulate, due to its kinetic nature and the presence of steep gradients requiring fine numerical resolution. In this work, a new well-conditioned method for determining the coefficients for Schoenberg's ``best'' quadrature is presented, providing improved precision compared to a naive approach based on b-spline derivatives (4 extra significant figures of precision are obtained for coefficients of the fifth order scheme). The construction of a simulation grid from Greville abcissae of judiciously chosen non-uniform knots is shown to reduce the memory requirements by 89\% for the simulation presented. Cubic splines are found to provide a good compromise between fast convergence and controlled oscillations preserving positivity. Despite the reduction in performance associated with using non-uniform spline schemes, effective parallelisation through the use of GPUs leads to non-uniform simulations running 5.5 times faster than uniform simulations providing equivalent results.},

  abstract = {This article is an account of the NABUCO project achieved during the summer camp CEMRACS 2019 devoted to geophysical fluids and gravity flows. The goal is to construct finite difference approximations of the transport equation with nonzero incoming boundary data that achieve the best possible convergence rate in the maximum norm. We construct, implement and analyze the so-called inverse Lax-Wendroff procedure at the incoming boundary. Optimal convergence rates are obtained by combining sharp stability estimates for extrapolation boundary conditions with numerical boundary layer expansions. We illustrate the results with the Lax-Wendroff and               O               3 schemes.                        ,              Cet article est un compte-rendu du projet NABUCO r\'ealis\'e au cours du CEMRACS 2019 qui \'etait consacr\'e aux fluides g\'eophysiques et aux \'ecoulements gravitaires. Le but est de construire des approximations par diff\'erences finies de l'\'equation de transport avec une condition d'entr\'ee non-nulle qui donnent lieu au meilleur taux de convergence possible dans la norme de la convergence uniforme.

In this paper, we model this interaction as a stationary and bi-kinetic Vlasov-Poisson-Amp`ere boundary value problem with boundary conditions that are consistent with the physics. In particular, we show that the wall potential can be determined from the ampibolarity of the particle flows as the unique solution of a non linear equation. Based on variational techniques, our analysis establishes the wellposedness of the model, provided that the incoming ion distribution satisfies a moment condition that generalizes the historical Bohm criterion of plasma physics. Quantitative estimates are also given, together with numerical illustrations that validate the robustness of our approach.},

As expected from the rate-of-convergence theory by Gustafsson, global order of accuracy is preserved if outflow boundary computations employ extrapolation of (local) accuracy of the same order.},

  abstract = {Large-scale instability of gravitating systems plays a key role in collisionless relaxation and in reaching a quasi-stationary state at the early stage of evolution. Advanced high-resolution methods and permanently increasing performance of computational systems allow this phenomenon to be studied by means of computer simulations at a new level. In this paper, an approach to verification and validation of computer codes implementing high-resolution methods is proposed. The approach is based on comparisons of the simulation results with exact non-stationary solutions of the Vlasov-Poisson equations. The evolution of the gravitating layer model is considered as an example of implementation of this approach. A one-parameter family of exact models of a non-stationary gravitating layer is described, and their stability to large-scale disturbances in the linear approximation is analytically studied. Non-linear instability development is computed with the use of the fifth-order conservative semi-Lagrangian WENO scheme.},
